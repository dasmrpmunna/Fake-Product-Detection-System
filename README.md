# Fake Product Detection System

**Fake Product Review Detection System üìå** The Fake Product Review Detection System is a machine learning-powered web application designed to analyze and detect fake reviews on eCommerce platforms. It helps users identify whether a product has genuine or manipulated reviews by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning models.

## Features ü™∂

| **Module**                     | **Description**                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fake Review Detection**      | Classifies reviews as Fake or Original using a trained ML model.                                         |
| **User-Friendly Interface**    | Simple, intuitive UI built with React & Tailwind CSS.                                                    |
| **API Integration**            | Connects to a Flask backend for real-time predictions.                                                   |
| **Data Upload Support**        | Allows users to upload review datasets for batch analysis.                                               |
| **Visualization & Insights**   | Displays review authenticity percentage with meaningful insights.                                        |
| **Fast & Efficient**           | Uses vectorization techniques for quick text processing.                                                 |

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
‚úÖ **Frontend:** Vite + React + Tailwind CSS.  
‚úÖ **Backend:** FastAPI / Flask (REST API).    
‚úÖ **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression).  
‚úÖ **Model Storage:** Joblib for saving and loading .pkl models.  
‚úÖ **Data Processing:** Pandas & NumPy.



## How It Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Machine Learning model on real & fake reviews dataset. <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Save the trained model as model.pkl.  <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the backend server to expose a REST API. <br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the React frontend to interact with the API. <br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ Upload or enter product reviews to get authenticity results <br>


**This system empowers consumers to make informed purchasing decisions by identifying fraudulent product reviews!**
